Browser-based MIDI synthesizer that leverages the Web Midi API to allow users to plug in a 37-key USB MIDI keyboard; user without access to a MIDI piano can use their mouse via the virtual piano keyboard.

Created two visualizations using HTML5 Canvas; used CSS3 for styling and Flexbox for layout;
provided the mechanisms for sound creation and manipulation/synthesis using Web Audio API, including an envelope generator and filter controls; organized code into maintainable and extensible components using React.js; deployed to Surge.
